## SIR Model 

This repository contains a Python implementation of a SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model for political radicalization. The model simulates the effects of relative income, elite overproduction, and demographic pressures on societal stability.

### Description

The code simulates a structural-demographic model using an extended SIR framework. It incorporates historical transitions in relative income, youth bulge effects, and elite overproduction to model societal instability. The simulation updates parameters over time and plots the results to visualize the evolution of relative income, radicalization, and elite fractions.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:
